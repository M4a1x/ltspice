# LTspiceIV
LTspiceIV unmodified redistribution. Each distribution gets it's own branch. They contain the files of the installation folder of LTspiceIV.
The master branch contains a script for extracting the installtion folder of the ".exe". Which was a small script for Version 4 and now outdated. I'm keeping it up for personal reference.

Any help and suggestions are welcome. Especially regarding the extraction of the program files without starting the installer, i.e. by using linux tools.
